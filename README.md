Exploratory Data Analysis of Road Accidents in the United States

## Problem Statement
New CDC research finds that the United States (U.S.) had higher rates of motor vehicle crash deaths than most other high-income countries in 2019 and lagged behind these other countries in saving lives on the road. This project focuses on understanding the nature and causes of traffic accidents in the United States, which can help inform policies and interventions to reduce the number and severity of accidents.

## Dataset
The US Accidents dataset is a comprehensive dataset of over 2.8 million traffic accidents that occurred in the 49 states of the United States between February 2016 and December 2021. The dataset was collected from multiple sources, including various government agencies, traffic cameras, and third-party data providers. The dataset includes various attributes related to each accident, such as location, time, weather conditions, road conditions, the severity of the accident, and the number of vehicles involved. It also includes information about the drivers, such as their age, gender, and whether they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol.
